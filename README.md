## Description  
This project compares PA-RISC and MIPS R2000 architectures. The implementation includes a MIPS assembly program to add two numbers using the MARS simulator.

## Prerequisites

Ensure the following software and tools are installed before running the program:
- MARS Emulator (Version 4.5 or later)

Install MARS: https://github.com/dpetersanderson/MARS/releases/tag/v.4.5.1
- Java Runtime Environment (JRE) is required to run MARS.
- Git for version control

Install Git: https://git-scm.com/
- Text Editor (Visual Studio Code or any editor that supports assembly files.)


## Structure  
- **src/**: Contains the MIPS program (`main.asm`).
- README.md file  

## How to Run  
1. Open `src/main.asm` in MARS.  
2. Click "Assemble" and "Run".
